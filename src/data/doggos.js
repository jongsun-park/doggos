    fullDescription: `The Korean Jindo, commonly known as the Jindo dog or Jindo, is a lesser-known dog breed that has unmatched loyalty to its owners. Originally from Jindo Island in South Korea, this medium-sized wolf-like dog is known for its high intelligence and dedication to its owner. Not much was known about these fantastic canines on an international level until Korean expatriates brought them to the United States in the 1980s. Now, dog-lovers are starting to realize what a treasure the Jindo dog is!
      \nThe Jindo dog’s origins date back hundreds of years, probably evolving as a crossbreed between dogs indigenous to South Korea and dogs brought over during the Mongol invasions. This mix has provided the Jindo dog with a thick coat, excellent homing skills, and incredible hunting ability. Jindo dogs are also natural jumpers and can quickly get over a short fence in no time!
      \nAlthough the Jindo dog is one of the rarer dog breeds found in the U.S. and is not yet recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) as a new dog breed, they should be on the top of your list when considering getting a loyal four-legged companion. If you have a desire for a dog that is legendary for its devotion and intelligence, read more about the Jindo dog and how it can become a part of your life.`,
